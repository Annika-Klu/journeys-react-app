# Journeys - a fictional travel blog

This project was created with React.js and connects to a Node server. The data - blog entries - is stored in a JSON file.

## Features

Displays blog entries with author name and image. On clicking on an entry, you can view its details.
All entries (more precisely, their locations) are marked on the map integrated with Google's Javascript map API and Geocode API. It is also possible to add a new entry, however the entry is only temporarily available because it is not stored in a database.

## This project is discontinued

This blog was a graduation project when I had just learned how to code. I've now discarded plans to add new fatures as I would first need to refactor the entire application code. Therefore, I'll focus on newer projects I have since created, and will leave this one as is. In fact I think that's even nicer, as this project represents the beginning of my own journey: the journey to becoming a developer.

As for that: The live version linked to in the repo might also be paused/inactive inbetween.
